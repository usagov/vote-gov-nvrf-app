# Vote.gov National Voter Registration Form app (NVRF app)

This repository contains the files of the National Voter Registration Form (NVRF) filler app embedded on vote.gov website. This app is built using Vite and React integrating data from API endpoints found on vote.gov.

## Requirements

Node: https://nodejs.org/en/  
NVM: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

## Getting started

### Installation

Use NVM to load the designated node version for running the app and install all dependencies.

```
nvm use
npm install
```

### Running the app locally

Initiate the app on localhost to access via your browser.

```
npm start
```

### Running a build

There are two scenarios to generate build assets:

#### Building for Pages.cloud.gov

This ensures that the assets get built in the appropriate location for delivery on pages.cloud.gov

```
npm run pages
```

#### Building for vote.gov

This ensures that the assets get build appropriately for delivery on vote.gov

```
npm run build
```

## Development

The NVRF app is built on Vite and React using USWDS React components from the [Trussworks USWDS React component library](https://trussworks.github.io/react-uswds/).

## Testing

See [testing README](/testing/README.md).

## Deployment

Currently CORS rules prevents the app from being hosted anywhere but vote.gov.
But generally speaking to deploy the app you must:

1. Run the build process to create the `/dist` files.
2. Host the `/assets` files on your server and copy the pdfs into root `/files/*.pdf` location.
3. Embed the app in a web page

```
<!-- Ensure that your html tag has valid 'lang' and `dir` attributes -->
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
<!-- Load dependencies in the head -->
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/main.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="/assets/main.css">

<!-- Embedded REACT app -->
<div class="nvrf-app-container" data-returnPath='https://vote.gov/register/alabama' data-stateId="al" id="root"></div>
```

`data-returnPath`: valid url path back to the state page

`data-stateId`: valid state abbreviation
